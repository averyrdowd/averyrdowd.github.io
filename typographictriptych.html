        <p class="projectdescription"><br><br>This work was part of a series consisting of three triptychs advertising a film festival only showing films that were banned around the world.
            Each poster represents a day of the festival and shares what will happen.
            The bold terms noted focus on the overall theme of that day.<br><br>
            To complicate the message being relayed, I printed out the title, cut it up, and pasted it back together.
            The broken words created new shapes and spaces that were intriguing to explore.
            The information is spread out and you have to search to find the answers you are looking for.

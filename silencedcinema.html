        <p class="projectdescription"><br><br>This work was part of a series consisting of three triptychs advertising a film festival only showing films that were banned around the world.
            Each poster represents a day of the festival and shares what will happen on that day.
            The bold terms noted focus on the overall theme of that day.<br><br>
            In addition to the Repetition Triptych, the eye motif was used as an observing watchful figure once again.
            Splitting apart and moving around, the advertisement was played up above an auditorium looking down upon the viewers.
            The overall festival information is shared but becareful not to blink or you may miss it.

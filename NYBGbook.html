        <p class="projectdescription"><br><br>After exploring New York City, three libraries were selected to create books on.
            Each book had to explore a topic that was found in the library or related to the library.<br><br>
            After visiting the New York Botanical Garden library in Queens, I was obsessed with the plant specimin books filling the shelves.
            As a way to get more in touch with nature, I created a poetry guide through the garden.
            Readers are encouraged to explore the grounds and visit each plant in the book to further delve into the litterature and the plant life.

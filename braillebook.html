        <p class="projectdescription"><br><br>After exploring New York City, three libraries were selected to create books on.
            Each book had to explore a topic that was found in the library or related to the library.<br><br>
            The Andrew Haskell Braille Library is a place for the visually impared to read books translated into braille and listen to audiobooks.
            During my visit, I realized my experience in this place was much different than someone who could understand braille.
            In an exploration to further understand language and perception, I included 5 different stories in one book.
            English, French, German, Mandarin, and Braille each bring the reader through a different journey depending on what they can comprehend.

        <p class="projectdescription"><br><br>Smoking is an epidemic that has taken over the world, specifically at art schools.
            After being tasked with creating a PSA, I decided to look around me and see what I noticed. 
            So many people of all ages smoke cigarette after cigarette ignoring the terrible graphic images on the boxes.<br><br>
            While brainstorming, I watched the movie Euro Trip.
            The intro credits had me glued to the screen in a elaborate infographic.
            After being inspired, I animated the PSA short Smoking Kills narrated by Mark Seeliger.
